A web-based application for a small hotel chain that allows potential customers to reserve rooms based on availability. The customers can enter their personal details, select a room, and book a reservation, all through a user-friendly interface.

# Technical Features:

• Backend: php laravel

• Use Composer as a dependency management tool. Implement Twig to manage the views and create a consistent look and feel across all pages.
