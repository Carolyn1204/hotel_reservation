Requirements:
1. Form Validation:
o Create a form that collects necessary data from customers, such as their 
name, email, phone number, check-in, and check-out dates. Ensure frontend validation using JavaScript and back-end validation using PHP. Invalid 
or incomplete submissions should not be accepted.
2. Front-End Side:
o Use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a responsive, user-friendly 
interface for the hotel reservation system.
3. Back-End Side:
o Implement the server-side logic in PHP. If you prefer, you are required to use 
Laravel for this purpose.
4. Read Data from a Text File:
o Create functionality to read room details (like room number, capacity, rate, 
etc.) from a text file.
5. Connection to a Database Table:
o Store customer information and their booking details in a relational 
database (like MySQL). Establish a connection to this database using PHP.
6. Composer and Twig:
o Use Composer as a dependency management tool. Implement Twig to 
manage the views and create a consistent look and feel across all pages.
7. Basic Security Concerns:
o Employ best practices to handle user data and database connections 
securely. This includes hashing passwords, validating and sanitizing user 
input to prevent SQL injection, and using secure connections where 
necessary.
8. SEO Compatibility:
o Address some SEO compatibility essentials, including the proper use of 
meta tags, keyword placement, alt text for images, and creating a robots.txt 
file.
9. Web API Call:
o Implement a feature that uses a public Web API to provide weather forecast 
information for the location of the hotel. This feature will assist guests in 
planning their stay.
10.(OPTIONAL) JavaScript Client Implementation:
pg. 4
o Implement a JavaScript client that interacts with the server to provide a 
smooth user experience, such as dynamically updating available rooms 
based on selected dates without refreshing the page.
